== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all classes. For more information, checkout the
full array of rake tasks with <tt>rake -T</tt>

Rake can be found at https://ruby.github.io/rake/.

== Running by hand

Run a single test suite:

   rake test TEST=path/to/test.rb

which can be further narrowed down to one test:

   rake test TEST=path/to/test.rb TESTOPTS="--name=test_something"

== Dependency on Active Record and database setup

Test cases in the +test/activerecord/+ directory depend on having
activerecord+ and +sqlite3+ installed. If Active Record is not in
actionview/../activerecord+ directory, or the +sqlite3+ Ruby gem is not installed,
  these tests are skipped.
Other tests are runnable from a fresh copy of actionview without any configuration.
